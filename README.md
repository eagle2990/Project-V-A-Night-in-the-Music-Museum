# VR Nanodegree
## Fifth Project - A Night in the Music Museum

By Eduardo Alejandro Guzman Lau Len

---

This project took me a long time (2.5 months approx.), because I learned many things with it, including:
* Use of render texture to show real time images
* GoogleVR SDK 1.60
* Displaying video in multi-platforms
* Use of Maya3D to try to create assets

Due to limited resources the design and assets are pretty simple, I focused this project in research and development of different techniques to play videos, "teleportation" movement and more.
